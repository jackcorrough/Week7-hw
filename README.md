Web forms

Creating a survey asking the user questions about themselves. In this survey I use input boxes, radio buttons, dropdown boxes, and checkmarks.
The HTML scripts I wrote for the survey and thank you pages are good examples of best practices in web development. Here are a few reasons why:

First, the scripts are well-structured and easy to read. The HTML tags are properly nested and indented, making it easy for developers to understand the structure of the page and modify it as needed. This helps ensure that the code is maintainable and can be easily updated in the future.

Second, the scripts make good use of semantic HTML. This means that the HTML tags used on the page reflect the meaning and purpose of the content they contain. For example, the h1 tag is used for the main heading of the page, the form tag is used to create a form, and the label tag is used to associate text with form elements. This makes the code more accessible and easier for search engines to understand.

Third, the scripts use appropriate form elements for collecting user input. The survey page uses input boxes and radio buttons for collecting the user's name and gender, while the second page uses dropdown boxes and checkboxes for collecting additional information about the user. These form elements are well-suited to the type of input being collected, and provide a good user experience.

Fourth, I was able to get more practice with Git and Github which I am still becoming more familiar with.

Finally, the scripts make use of JavaScript to handle user input and page navigation. The "Submit" button on the second page uses a JavaScript function to redirect the user to the thank you page when clicked. This helps ensure that the page works as expected, even if JavaScript is disabled in the user's browser.

Overall, these HTML scripts demonstrate good practices in web development, and can serve as a useful starting point for building more complex web applications.
